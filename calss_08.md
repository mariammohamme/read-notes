# Forms and Events
- event :The user can enter a name which is displayed in the heading, and they can press record (which changes the image that is
shown).
- submit : When a form is submitted, the submit event fires on the node representing the <form> element.
- change: Fires when the status of several form elements change
 a selection is made from a drop-down select box: 
• a radio button is selected
• a checkbox is selected or deselected
- The keyboard events are fired when a user interacts with the keyboard
- input: Fires when the value of an <input> or <textarea> element changes.
- keydown : Fires when the user presses any key on the keyboard. If the user holds down a key, the event
continues to fire repeatedly
- keypress :Fires when the user presses a key that would result in a character being shown on the screen. For
example, this event would not fire when the user presses the arrow keys
- keyup: Fires when the user releases a key on the keyboard. The keydown and keypress events fire before a
character shows on screen, whereas keyup fires after it appears. 
- The three events that begin key ... fire in this order:
1. keydown - user presses key down
2. keypress - user has pressed or is holding a key
that adds a character into the page
3. keyup - user releases key

properties.

use to control them and make them more consistent.
