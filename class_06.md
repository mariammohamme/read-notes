# HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions
### What's a Table?
--------------
represents information in a grid format.Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.
### what is table cell
----------
block in the grid is referred to as a table cell. In HTML a table is written out row by row
### what the Basic Table Structure
-------------
- <table> :The element is used to create a table
- <tr> :You indicate the start of each row using the opening  tag.
- <td> :Each cell of a table is represented using a element
### what the Table Headings
------------
- <th> element is used just like the <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for tableheading.)
- The <table> element is used to add tables to a web page.
- X A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the <tr> element.
- X Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a header).
- X You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- X For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>. 
### what is the function 
-----------
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
- function declaration:  creates a function that you can call later in your code. It is the type of function you have seen so far in this book.
- FUNCTION EXPRESSION: If you put a function where the interpreter would expect to see an expression, then it is treated as an expression, and it is known as a function expression. In function expressions, the name is usually omitted.
- IMMEDIATELY INVOKED FUNCTION :EXPRESSIONS (llFE) Pronounced "iffy," these functions are not given
a name. Instead, they are executed once as the interpreter comes across them. 
- WHEN TO USE ANONYMOUS :FUNCTIONS AND llFES You will see many ways in which anonymous function expressions and llFEs are used throughout the book. 
- LOCAL VARIABLES :When a variable is created inside a function using the var keyword, it can only be used in that function. It is called a local variable or function-level variable. It is said to have local scope or function-level scope
- GLOBAL VARIABLES :If you create a variable outside of a function, then it
can be used anywhere within the script. It is called a global variable and has global scope. In the example
shown, wa 11 Size is a global variable. 
- CREATING THE VARIABLES IN CODE :Each variable that you declare takes up memory.The more variables a browser has to remember, the more memory your script requires to run. 
- NAMING COLLISIONS :You might think you would avoid naming collisions; after all you know which variables you are using.
- Objects is : group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
